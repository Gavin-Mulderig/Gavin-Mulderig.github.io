projects: 
I have started but not finished a scrap book of my time at tritech. Also I've been working on python scripts at home
to try and make fun and cool shapes and images in turtle.

At Tri-Tech I have done a lot of cool projects in turtle and other platforms. Here are some examples of my work.
<a href="keldeo.py">* mcpi </a> 
<img src="mega.png" width = "500" height = "600" class="left" />
<img src="bonfire.png" width = "400" height = "600"  class="center" />
