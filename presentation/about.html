I am 17 and I never like to take things seriously and like to make things fun by trying to make everyone
around me feel better then I do. I have been interested in Cyber Security ever since I was in middle school.
I have learned and grew over the years of being under colemans wing. When I first started I barely knew how to 
work a terminal or any os other then windows.When I first came to Tri-Tech I thought Coleman was just some 
crazy Doc Brown impersonator. But now he is a great mentor, friend, master of time space and demension, and teacher. 

Before coming to Tri-Tech I only knew three people who I could call a good friend. After coming to Tri-Tech 
I have made so many great friends and companions for life. Tritech has taught me how to be myself and enjoy 
school and the people with you. I have gotten over being really shy barely being able to talk to people to 
being a more confident and better version of me.I have enjoyed my years at Tri-Tech and hope to inspire more
people to join and love Tri-Tech as much as I do.
