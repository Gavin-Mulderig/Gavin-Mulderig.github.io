<p style="text-align:left"> 
Application Layer
The application layer sits at the top of the OSI model. It functions as a helper of somesorts in
which it ensures that an application can communicate with other applications on different
computers, systems and networks. While the name may make you assume so. It is not an
application itself. Instead it is a component in applications that control the communication
method to other devices.

Protocols
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

A set of rules that computers use to transfer files such as text, images, sound, video and other
forms of media. How it works is that resources are exchanged between the client devices and
the servers. The devices send requests for resources necessary for the web page, the servers
then send the information back from the request.

FTP: File Transfer Protocol

FTP allows individuals and businesses to share files without being in the same place. They
send information through a FTP client such as FileZilla and FTP Voyager or through the cloud. It
relies on two communication channels between the client and server, a command channel for
controlling a conversation and a data channel for transmitting file content

DNS: Domain Name System

It is a naming database that locates and translates domain names into Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses. For example if someone were to type “tritechsc.org” in a web browser, a server
would take that domain name and mark it to a certain IP address. Something similar to the
structure of 203.0.113.72.

SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol

SNMP is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices on a LAN or WAN scale. Its
purpose is to provide network devices, such as routers, servers and printers with an
understandable language that they can use to share information within the Network
Management System (NMS). The SNMP client has 3 components. The SNMP agent, which acts
as a server. The SNMP manager, which acts as the client and a management information base
(MIB), which acts as the servers database.

The manager asks the agent a question, the client then gets the MIB to supply the answer.
