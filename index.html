Application Layer                                                                                        Protocols

The application layer sits at the top of the OSI model. It functions as a helper of somesorts in         HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
which it ensures that an application can communicate with other applications on different                A set of rules that computers use to transfer files such as text, images, sound, video and other
computers, systems and networks. While the name may make you assume so. It is not an                     forms of media. How it works is that resources are exchanged between the client devices and
application itself. Instead it is a component in applications that control the communication             the servers. The devices send requests for resources necessary for the web page, the servers
method to other devices.                                                                                 then send the information back from the request.

                                                                                                         FTP allows individuals and businesses to share files without being in the same place. They

                                                                                                         controlling a conversation and a data channel for transmitting file content

                                                                                                         DNS: Domain Name System

                                                                                                         It is a naming database that locates and translates domain names into Internet Protocol (IP)
                                                                                                         addresses. For example if someone were to type “tritechsc.org” in a web browser, a server
                                                                                                         would take that domain name and mark it to a certain IP address. Something similar to the
                                                                                                         structure of 203.0.113.72.

                                                                                                         SNMP is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices on a LAN or WAN scale. Its
                                                                                                         purpose is to provide network devices, such as routers, servers and printers with an
                                                                                                         understandable language that they can use to share information within the Network
                                                                                                         Management System (NMS). The SNMP client has 3 components. The SNMP agent, which acts
                                                                                                         as a server. The SNMP manager, which acts as the client and a management information base
                                                                                                         (MIB), which acts as the servers database.

                                                                                                         The manager asks the agent a question, the client then gets the MIB to supply the answer.
